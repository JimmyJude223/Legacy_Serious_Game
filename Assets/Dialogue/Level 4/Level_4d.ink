I know we should be focusing on the city and making it grow larger, but I dont think poisoning the river is the way, I heard a lot of people have gotten ill, I really hope this was just a lapse of judgment you have made.
On the other hand maybe people will wake up a bit and realize that in order to keep this city as is, we need a constant flow of products.
